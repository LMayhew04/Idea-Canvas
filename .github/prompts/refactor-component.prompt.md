I need you to refactor a component to improve its structure and maintainability, following the project's architectural principles.

**Your Task:**
1.  Analyze the provided component file (`@workspace` will have the file open).
2.  Identify areas that violate the Single Responsibility Principle or contain overly complex logic (e.g., state management, event handling, UI rendering all mixed together).
3.  Propose a refactoring plan. This should involve extracting logic into smaller, reusable components or custom hooks.
4.  Execute the refactoring plan.
5.  Ensure that after refactoring, all existing tests continue to pass. If the refactoring makes a test obsolete, update the test accordingly.
